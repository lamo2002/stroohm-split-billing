## Slide 1: Title
**"Split Billing Proposal"**

*"Hi — as promised, here's our proposal for split billing.*

*I'll walk you through the problem we're solving, the options we considered, and our recommendation for the best approach.*

*This should take about 10 minutes. Let's get into it."*

**Duration:** ~20 seconds

---

## Slide 2: What We'll Cover
**Agenda slide**

*"Here's what we'll cover:*

*First, the problem — why fleet charging costs are hard to control today.*

*Then the options — the different approaches to split billing.*

*Our recommendation — which approach we think works best and why.*

*And finally, the roadmap — how we'll deliver this together."*

**Duration:** ~25 seconds

---

## Slide 3: Section — Problem & Opportunity
**Blue section divider**

*"Let's start with the problem."*

**Duration:** ~5 seconds (just a beat)

---

## Slide 4: Key Considerations
**Needs & challenges grid**

*"Fleet charging costs are unpredictable — and today, you face a painful trade-off.*

*On one side: you could block expensive charging. But that frustrates drivers, creates operational overhead, and doesn't scale.*

*On the other side: you allow all charging. But then costs are unpredictable, budgets overrun, and finance asks questions you can't easily answer.*

*What's needed is cost control without restricting drivers. Set limits, keep the charging experience seamless.*

*That's what split billing solves — and getting it right matters. Done poorly, mid-route blocking frustrates drivers. Unexpected deductions create HR issues. Confusing rules undermine trust.*

*We've thought carefully about these challenges."*

**Duration:** ~50 seconds

---

## Slide 5: A Note on the Contract
**Acknowledging the request**

*"Before we look at the options, let me acknowledge what you asked for.*

*Price threshold per kWh is committed in the contract. We took that seriously and researched how to best deliver on your cost control goals.*

*What we found is that the market offers several approaches to split billing — each with different trade-offs.*

*Let me walk you through the options, share our recommendation, and then we can decide together what works best for Stroohm."*

**Duration:** ~35 seconds

---

## Slide 6: Split Billing Models
**Four options overview**

*"There are four main approaches to split billing:*

*Monthly Budget — the company pays up to a fixed amount per month. Driver pays any excess.*

*Price Threshold — the company pays up to a certain price per kWh. Driver pays the difference on expensive charges.*

*Day/Time — the company only pays during work hours or on work days.*

*Percentage — a fixed split, like 80/20.*

*Each has trade-offs. Let me zoom in on the two most relevant for Stroohm."*

**Duration:** ~40 seconds

---

## Slide 7: Price Threshold
**Deep dive on threshold**

*"First, Price Threshold — the approach in your contract.*

*How it works: you set a maximum price per kWh. If a charger costs more, the driver pays the difference.*

*The strengths: it directly controls which chargers get used. Drivers naturally avoid expensive chargers. And it's intuitive — a price cap makes sense.*

*But there are challenges:*

*Total cost is still unpredictable — a driver charging 1,000 kWh at 49 cents still costs you 490 euros.*

*It only covers the kWh price — not parking fees, idle fees, or session fees.*

*And dynamic pricing creates complexity — what happens when the price changes mid-session?"*

**Duration:** ~50 seconds

---

## Slide 8: Monthly Budget
**Deep dive on budget**

*"Now let's look at Monthly Budget.*

*How it works: you set a monthly allowance per driver. The company pays everything up to that limit. Once the budget is used, the driver pays from their own wallet.*

*The strengths: total cost is predictable — you know exactly your maximum spend. Drivers self-regulate to stretch their budget. It covers all fees — kWh, parking, idle, everything. It's simple to explain. And finance loves it — they can budget in euros, not kilowatt-hours.*

*The challenges: it requires drivers to track their budget. And it doesn't directly control which chargers they use — though the incentive does that naturally."*

**Duration:** ~50 seconds

---

## Slide 9: Our Recommendation
**Monthly Budget first**

*"Based on our analysis, we recommend starting with Monthly Budget.*

*You asked for price threshold — we heard you, and we'll build it if needed.*

*But Monthly Budget solves the bigger problem: cost predictability. You know your maximum exposure per driver per month. Full stop.*

*And here's the key insight: when drivers have a monthly budget, they naturally avoid expensive chargers. Why? Because an 80-cent charger eats through their budget twice as fast as a 40-cent charger.*

*You get threshold behavior without setting a threshold. The budget creates it automatically.*

*We're not saying no to threshold. We're saying: let's start with what solves the core problem, validate together, and add threshold if we find it's truly needed."*

**Duration:** ~60 seconds

---

## Slide 10: How It Works
**Monthly Budget in action**

*"Let me show you how Monthly Budget works in practice.*

*Example: a driver has a 200 euro monthly budget. They've used 180 euros. They start a charge that costs 25 euros.*

*The company pays the remaining 20 euros of budget. The driver pays the 5 euro excess.*

*The key: the driver sees this before they charge. No surprises. They know exactly what they'll pay.*

*And this transparency changes behavior. Most drivers will naturally stay within budget. If they consistently need more, they'll ask for a budget increase — which is a conversation you want to have, not a surprise on an invoice.*

*The ideal outcome? Drivers self-regulate, stay within budget, and the split rarely actually happens."*

**Duration:** ~55 seconds

---

## Slide 11: Section — Milestones
**Blue section divider**

*"Let me show you how we'll deliver this."*

**Duration:** ~5 seconds

---

## Slide 12: Roadmap
**Q2/Q3 delivery**

*"Here's the roadmap.*

*V0 is the foundation — the core infrastructure to split a charge between two wallets. This is what everything else builds on.*

*V1 is Monthly Budget — full configuration in the Hub, budget visibility in the app, and finance exports. This is the production-ready solution.*

*V2 and V3 — Day/Time rules and Price Threshold — come later, if needed. We're not closing the door on them. We're sequencing based on what delivers value fastest."*

**Duration:** ~40 seconds

---

## Slide 13: V1 Scope
**What's included**

*"Let me be specific about what V1 includes.*

*For fleet managers: you'll configure budgets in the Hub — per driver or per group. You'll see utilization across your fleet and export reports for finance.*

*For drivers: they'll see their remaining budget before charging, get a clear breakdown of company vs personal cost, and never be surprised by a deduction.*

*V1 is a complete solution — not a beta. Production-ready split billing.*

*And remember: the ideal outcome is that drivers self-regulate. They stay within budget or ask for an increase. The split rarely happens."*

**Duration:** ~45 seconds

---

## Slide 14: Next Steps
**Close**

*"To wrap up:*

*We're building split billing. It's happening.*

*Our recommendation is to start with Monthly Budget — it solves cost predictability, drivers self-regulate, and it's faster to ship.*

*Price threshold is not off the table. If validation shows it's truly needed, we build it.*

*Here are the questions I'd love your input on: Does Monthly Budget solve your core use case? Are there edge cases we should know about?*

*Let's schedule a call to discuss. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.*

*Talk soon."*

**Duration:** ~45 seconds

## Key Messages to Land

1. **We heard you** — Threshold is in the contract, we're not ignoring it
2. **Budget solves the bigger problem** — Total cost predictability
3. **Budget creates threshold behavior** — Drivers self-regulate naturally
4. **The split rarely happens** — Ideal outcome is behavior change, not billing complexity

## Recording Tips

- Pace yourself — the slides are clean, let them breathe
- Emphasize "the split rarely happens" — this is the key insight
- Sound collaborative, not defensive about threshold
- End with clear questions — make it easy for them to respond
